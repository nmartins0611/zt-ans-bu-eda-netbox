_An introduction to the Ansible Automation Platform web UI, covering the Overview, Inventories, Projects, and Job Templates._

== Lab Overview

Welcome to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. The new unified web UI in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 has integrated all components into a single dashboard. In this workshop, we will explore the **Automation Execution** (automation controller) and **Automation Decision** (Event-Driven Ansible) functionalities.

First, log in to Ansible Automation Platform to begin the exercises.

== Task 1: Explore the Overview Dashboard

Your first task is to explore the **Overview** dashboard. The initial screen will show little information due to the lack of recent activity, but you can compare it again after you finish the lab to see the difference.

You will find the following sections:

* **Resource counts:** A summary of your *hosts*, *projects*, and *inventories*.
* **Job activity:** A graph showing job runs from the past month.
* **Jobs:** A list of recently run jobs.
* **Projects:** A list of recently updated projects.
* **Inventories:** A list of recently updated inventories.

A new feature in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 is a section with quick start guides and interactive tutorials, which is very useful for getting started right after an installation.

== Task 2: Explore the Inventories Section

An **inventory** is a collection of hosts against which playbooks can be run. It's the same concept as an inventory file you might be familiar with from the command line, but with added features and better reusability.

.   **Navigate to the Inventories page** by going to **Automation Execution** → **Infrastructure** → **Inventories** in the left navigation menu. Then, **explore the Demo Inventory** by clicking on its name. Take some time to explore the different tabs and familiarize yourself with the available fields. You will create your own inventory soon.

== Task 3: Explore the Projects Section

A **project** is a logical grouping of Ansible Playbooks within the automation controller. These playbooks typically reside in a source code version control system like Git.

.   **Navigate to the Projects page** by going to **Automation Execution** → **Projects** in the left navigation menu. Then, **explore the Demo Project** by clicking on its name. Examine the different fields and tabs available.

== Task 4: Explore Job Templates

A **job template** is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. Job templates are useful for executing the same job many times and they encourage the reuse of Ansible content and collaboration between teams.

.   **Navigate to the Templates page** by going to **Automation Execution** → **Templates** in the left navigation menu. Then, **explore the Demo Job Template** by clicking on its name to see its configuration. You will be creating your own Job Templates later in this workshop.
