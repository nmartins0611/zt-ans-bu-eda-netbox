_A guide to understanding the core components of Event-Driven Ansible in the Automation Platform UI: Decision Environments, Credentials, and Projects._

== Introduction to Automation Decisions

Event-Driven Ansible allows you to codify your response to infrastructure and application events, making your automation more resilient and responsive. While **Automation Controller** (via playbooks) automates a response, **Event-Driven Ansible** (via rulebooks) automates the recognition of the event itself. By describing the conditions for an action and specifying the response, you can respond to issues much more quickly.

With Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, all components are co-located in a new, unified user experience. You will find the **Automation Decisions** (Event-Driven Ansible) UI in the same interface as **Automation Execution** (Automation Controller).

First, switch to the `AAP` tab and log in.

== Exploring Event-Driven Ansible Controller Resources

Just like Automation Controller, the Event-Driven Ansible controller requires several resources to be configured before you can activate a rulebook. There are three main resource types you will work with in the **Automation Decisions** section of the UI.

=== Decision Environments

If you're familiar with Ansible **Execution Environments** (EEs), you will find that **Decision Environments** (DEs) are conceptually similar. The main difference is that EEs are built to execute *Playbooks*, whereas DEs are built to execute *Rulebooks*. Both are container images that bundle all the necessary dependencies, including the required Ansible Collections. Decision Environments must contain collections that provide `source plugins` for any event source you want to receive events from. For example, to receive events from Dynatrace, you would need a DE that includes the `dynatrace.event_driven_ansible` collection.

To explore the available Decision Environments, **navigate** to **Automation Decisions** → **Decision Environments** in the left-hand sidebar. You will notice two pre-configured environments: **Default Decision Environment** (distributed by Red Hat, includes `ansible.eda`) and **NetOps Decision Environment** (custom-built for this workshop).

=== Credentials

Credentials in Event-Driven Ansible can be used to pull content from private repositories (for both Decision Environments and Projects), connect to external event sources, and secure inbound webhooks via Event Streams.

To explore the existing Credentials, **navigate** to **Automation Decisions** → **Infrastructure** → **Credentials**. You will see a pre-loaded `AAP` credential, which will be used for Rulebook Activations in upcoming exercises.

=== Projects

Projects in Event-Driven Ansible are source control repositories that contain your *rulebooks*. They function just like Projects in the Automation Controller.

To explore Projects, **navigate** to **Automation Decisions** → **Projects**. This section is currently empty, but you will add a project in the next challenge.
